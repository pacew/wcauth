add expiration times to various database rows and a cleaner to the php

add managmement of local indexedDB records

do some key juggling so the key that gets stored in the browser is
marked "sign only" and non-exportable and the key that is sent to the
server is marked "verify only"

decide on key length and nonce length; make signer reject requests for
the wrong length nonce, or if it isn't all hex digits

write up security analysis ... will be pretty easy: the key is
generated for just this purpose and isn't shared with anything (like
ssh or gpg).  there are only 2 operations: browser signs nonce, and
server verifies the signature.  

mark the points where a user_id is abandoned during the linking
process.  provide hooks in case the application wants to merge data
from the old user_id to the new one

make it easier to incorporate into projects:

  maybe consolidate all the php into one file with various flags

  change the one use of jquery to plain javascript document ready

  separate from psite

  make parallel implementation for python servers
